    "A main component of the study of risk is the estimation of losses. A few examples are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A bank has a portfolio of loans that it has given out. Since not everyone will pay back their loans, they wish to estimate how much of this principal sum they are expected to retain or lose (don't feel too bad for them, the reason you pay interest on your loans is in part to cover these losses).\n",
    "2. A car insurer wants to estimate how much they will have to pay out in policy claims for a given year. This entails estimating how much a given policy is expected to claim during the year, and aggregating across all their policies.\n",
    "3. A firm wants to estimate how much in losses it can expect to incur due to fraud during a month, so that it can set money aside to cover these losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "One could try and model these losses directly, which would be a probability distribution of monetary losses, but a more common approach is to break this distribution into parts and model each one separately before combining to form the loss distribution. It is natural to consider the loss as the expected number of negative events or incidents that will occur, multiplied by the amount of monetary loss that is expected in the case of that event occuring:\n",

    "Consider starting from the binomial distribution, where we have $n$ independent bernoulli trials, for example flipping a coin a hundred times. This is a set of discrete events, where there is a clear distinction between one event and the next. But consider instead the case of an event that could occur at any point in time, such as a lightning strike. There are no discrete trials, since time is continuous, and therefore the probability of a lightning strike occuring at any particular point in time is infinitesimal. However, the probability distribution of the count of lightning strikes occuring is not infinitesimal. There is, in fact, an infinite number of trials each with an infinitesimally small chance of success, which results in a finite number of strikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to arrive at this view, you can imagine splitting up the time duration into n equally sized durations, for example start with 100 minutes and split them into 10 minute intervals. We can then think of this as 10 independent trials of whether or not there is at least one lightning strike within each 10 minute window. If the probability of a lightning strike during the whole 100 minutes was $p$ then we assume that the probability of a lightning strike occuring during the 100 minutes must still be $p$. Therefore, the probability of a lightning strike occuring in the 10 minute window must be $p/10$, or to put it another way, the probability of a strike occuring in each window $p$, multiplied by the number of windows $n$ is constant i.e. the rate $np$ is constant. This therefore gives us an approximation to the distribution of the count of lightning strikes we can expect in the full 100 minutes. It is clearly only an approximation since it makes the assumption that there can only be one strike within each window. Now, we can further split these 10 minute windows into, say, 1 minute windows, so that we have 100 of them, again keeping the rate constant. This is a closer appromxation, since the interval is smaller. If we continue to divide our time interval into ever smaller intervals, we are taking the limit $n \\to \\infty$ with $np$ constant. This results in the Poisson distribution.\n",
