# Poisson and Binomial Distributions

## Bernoulli Distribution

The Bernoulli Distribution is the probability distribution for a single trial with a two valued outcome, usually characterised as success or failure. The Bernoulli distribution is typically parameterised by the probability p where $ 0 \leq p \leq 1 $, then it is given by:

$$
P(X = x; p) = p^{x}(1 - p)^{1 - x}
$$

## Binomial Distribution

The binomial distribution is the probability distribution for N independent Bernoulli trials. Keeping p as the probability for a single trial, the binomial distribution is given by:

$$
P(X = x; p, n) = \binom{n}{x} p^x (1-p)^{n-x}
$$

## Poisson Distribution

The Poisson distribution is given by:

$$
P(X = x; \lambda) = \frac{\lambda^{x} e^{-\lambda}}{x!}
$$

Where $\lambda$ defines the rate.
